# Retrofix Revisited (ES-DE Version)
This is port of the Retrofix theme by [20GotoTen](https://github.com/20GotoTen) for the version of EmulationStation used in [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/) v2.x.  
*(If you are using ES-DE v1.x or earlier please download [this version](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/retrofix-revisited-retropie) instead)*  

**The original theme idea was designed and created by 20GotoTen.  I made changes to the XML to make the theme compatible with RetroPie and added updated artwork. The original version of the theme can be found [here](https://github.com/20GotoTen/es-theme-retrofix)**

## Changes Made

- Removed all Batocera specific elements to make the theme compatible with ES-DE v2.0
- Updated system image names to match the standard used by ES-DE
- Created a 16:10 Layout Variant
- Added navigation sound set for ES-DE
- Updated system images and logos
- Embedded the ES-DE [system-metadata](https://gitlab.com/es-de/themes/system-metadata) repository to power system color highlights

## **Configuration Options**

- The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE 
   - Options:
   - `Theme Aspect Ratio`- sets the aspect ratio the theme will render at. If needed, this should be changed to match the aspect ratio of your screen.
   - `Theme Variant`- sets the layout used for the gamelist view when media & metadata are scraped for your games
- 16:9 & 16:10 aspect ratios are supported
- there are 3 gamelist layouts to choose from (immersive, simple & carousel)
